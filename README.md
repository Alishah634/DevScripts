# DevScripts Repository Description

## Goals
This repository aims to provide a collection of versatile scripts to help automate tasks and streamline workflows across various domains. Whether you are setting up a development environment, automating repetitive tasks, or exploring new tools and technologies, these scripts are designed to be a helpful starting point.

## Usage
To use any of the scripts, navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions provided in that folder's `README.md` file. The general steps to get started are:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Alishah634/DevScripts.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the script you want to use(in this case PackageSetup):
    ```sh
    cd DevScripts/PackageSetup
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the folder's `README.md` file to execute the script.

## Scripts that Exist
- PackageSetup: Set up a comprehensive Python environment by installing packages from a requirements file.
- template_file_structure.py: Is a script that sets up folders/directories for the user. Comes in handy when working on large projects.

## Rules for Contribution
- We welcome contributions to this repository! If you have a script that you believe would be a valuable addition, or if you have improvements to existing scripts, please feel free to submit a pull request. 
- Additionally, if you have any questions or need help, use the discussion section to reach out. 
- Scripts are prefered to be in ``python`` or ``bash``. However if a script is written in another langauge then after review it may be added. The reason for using ``python`` and ``bash`` is because those are easily accessible for all and require little to no setup before hand.
